    /// When a library is loaded, initialisation routines contained within it are executed.

    ///
    /// Additionally, the callers of this function must also ensure that execution of the
    /// termination routines contained within the library is safe as well. These routines may be
    /// executed when the library is unloaded.
    ///
    /// # Thread-safety
    ///
    /// The implementation strives to be as MT-safe as sanely possible, however on certain
    /// platforms the underlying error-handling related APIs not always MT-safe. This library
    /// shares these limitations on those platforms. In particular, on certain UNIX targets
    /// `dlerror` is not MT-safe, resulting in garbage error messages in certain MT-scenarios.
    ///
    /// Calling this function from multiple threads is not MT-safe if used in conjunction with
    /// library filenames and the library search path is modified (`SetDllDirectory` function on
    /// Windows, `{DY,}LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable on UNIX).
    ///
    /// # Platform-specific behaviour
    ///
    /// When a plain library filename is supplied, the locations in which the library is searched are
    /// platform specific and cannot be adjusted in a portable manner. See the documentation for
    /// the platform specific [`os::unix::Library::new`] and [`os::windows::Library::new`] methods
    /// for further information on library lookup behaviour.
    ///
    /// If the `filename` specifies a library filename without a path and with the extension omitted,
    /// the `.dll` extension is implicitly added on Windows.

    /// # Tips
    ///
    /// Distributing your dynamic libraries under a filename common to all platforms (e.g.
    /// `awesome.module`) allows you to avoid code which has to account for platform’s conventional
    /// library filenames.
    ///
    /// Strive to specify an absolute or at least a relative path to your library, unless
    /// system-wide libraries are being loaded. Platform-dependent library search locations
    /// combined with various quirks related to path-less filenames may cause flakiness in
    /// programs.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```no_run
    /// # use ::libloading::Library;
    /// // Any of the following are valid.
    /// unsafe {
    ///     let _ = Library::new("/path/to/awesome.module").unwrap();
    ///     let _ = Library::new("../awesome.module").unwrap();
    ///     let _ = Library::new("libsomelib.so.1").unwrap();
    /// }
    /// ```

    /// Get a pointer to a function or static variable by symbol name.
    ///
    /// The `symbol` may not contain any null bytes, with the exception of the last byte. Providing a
    /// null-terminated `symbol` may help to avoid an allocation.
    ///
    /// The symbol is interpreted as-is; no mangling is done. This means that symbols like `x::y` are
    /// most likely invalid.
    ///
    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// Users of this API must specify the correct type of the function or variable loaded.
    ///
    /// # Platform-specific behaviour
    ///
    /// The implementation of thread-local variables is extremely platform specific and uses of such
    /// variables that work on e.g. Linux may have unintended behaviour on other targets.
    ///
    /// On POSIX implementations where the `dlerror` function is not confirmed to be MT-safe (such
    /// as FreeBSD), this function will unconditionally return an error when the underlying `dlsym`
    /// call returns a null pointer. There are rare situations where `dlsym` returns a genuine null
    /// pointer without it being an error. If loading a null pointer is something you care about,
    /// consider using the [`os::unix::Library::get_singlethreaded`] call.
