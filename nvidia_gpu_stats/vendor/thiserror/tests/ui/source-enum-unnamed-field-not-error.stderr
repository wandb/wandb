error[E0599]: the method `as_dyn_error` exists for reference `&NotError`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

  |              ^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `&NotError` due to unsatisfied trait bounds

  = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `NotError: std::error::Error`
          which is required by `NotError: AsDynError<'_>`
          `&NotError: std::error::Error`
          which is required by `&NotError: AsDynError<'_>`
note: the trait `std::error::Error` must be implemented

  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following trait defines an item `as_dyn_error`, perhaps you need to implement it:
          candidate #1: `AsDynError`
