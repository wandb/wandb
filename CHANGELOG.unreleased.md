## Unreleased

### Added

- The automations API now supports team and organization scopes. (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12197, https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12194)
- The automations API now supports creating and editing automations whose scope is a `Registry` object (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10867)

### Changed

- `Api.{create,update}_automation()` now raise `UnsupportedError` instead of `CommError` when the server doesn't support the given automation (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12194)
- The message format used to communicate between internal processes has slightly changed. If you use `wandb beta core`, restart the service after upgrading `wandb`, as some operations may fail if the SDK and service versions differ. (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12374)
- `wandb.sandbox` now allows GPU resource requests for sandboxes instead of rejecting `resources.gpu` client-side (@nicholaspun-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12455)
- `wandb.init()` now honors `mode="offline"` and `resume="..."` instead of logging warning and ignoring the `resume` option. The requested mode is reconciled against the backend when the run is later synced with `wandb beta sync`. Only the `resume` options `"must"` and `"never"` are allowed;  `"allow"` and `"auto"` raise a `UsageError`. (@geoffhardy in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12110)
