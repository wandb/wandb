## Unreleased

### Deprecated

- `wandb.sandbox` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the `cwsandbox` package directly instead.

### Fixed

- File uploads and downloads no longer fail in some cases with `CommError: Failed to execute API request: the service process is busy and did not respond in time` when they take longer than 20 seconds. This was a regression in 0.29.0 (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12603)
- System metrics are now collected as soon as monitoring starts instead of after the first sampling interval (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12649)
- `wandb.init()` no longer waits for the GPU and TPU metrics collector to start (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12651)
- `wandb.Api()` no longer fails with `the service process is busy and did not respond in time` where the W&B host is slow to answer: the telemetry capability probe that runs during its initialization now gives up after 2 seconds instead of 10. This was a regression in 0.29.0 (@mitja-kleider in PR_URL)
