## Unreleased

### Added

- `wandb leet`: `shift+↑` and `shift+↓` scroll the rows of a heatmap system chart that has more series than fit, so every CPU core or GPU can be inspected (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/13189)

### Fixed

- `wandb leet symon` scaled the GPU PCIe and NVLink throughput charts and the Trainium memory charts by 1024³ on top of the bytes that the monitor reports, so their y-axis labels read like `7.67e+09GB/s` instead of `7.67GB/s` (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/13191)
