## Unreleased

### Added

- Settings `console_chunk_max_seconds` and `console_chunk_max_bytes` for size- and time-based multipart console logs file chunking (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10162)
- Registry API query methods (`Api.registries()`, `Registry.{collections,versions}()`, `Api.registries().{collections,versions}()`) now accept a `per_page` keyword arg to override the default batch size for paginated results (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10713).

### Changed

- API keys longer than 40 characters are now supported. (@jennwandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10688)

### Fixed

- `run.config` now properly returns a dict when calling `artifact.logged_by()` in v0.22.1 (@thanos-wandb in #10682)
- `wandb.Api(api_key=...)` now prioritizes the explicitly provided API key over thread-local cached credentials (@pingleiwandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10657)
- Fixed a rare deadlock in `console_capture.py` (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10683)
  - If you dump thread tracebacks during the deadlock and see the `wandb-AsyncioManager-main` thread stuck on a line in `console_capture.py`: this is now fixed.
- Fixed an issue where TensorBoard sync would sometimes stop working if the tfevents files were being written live (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10625)
- `Artifact.manifest` delays downloading **and** generating the download URL for the artifact manifest until it's first used.  If the manifest has not been locally modified, `Artifact.size` and `Artifact.digest` can return without waiting to fetch the full manifest (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10680)
