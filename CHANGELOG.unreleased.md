## Unreleased

### Added

- The new `reinit="create_new"` setting causes `wandb.init()` to create a new run even if other runs are active, without finishing the other runs (in contrast to `reinit="finish_previous"`). This will eventually become the default (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9562)

- Added `Artifact.history_step` to return the nearest run step at which history metrics were logged for the artifact's source run (@ibindlish in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9732)

### Changed

- `Artifact.download()` no longer raises an error when using `WANDB_MODE=offline` or when an offline run exists (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9695)

### Removed

- Dropped the `-q` / `--quiet` argument to the `wandb` magic in IPython / Jupyter; use the `quiet` run setting instead (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9705)

### Deprecated

- The following `wandb.Run` methods are deprecated in favor of properties and will be removed in a future release (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8925):
    - `run.project_name()` is deprecated in favor of `run.project`
    - `run.get_url()` method is deprecated in favor of `run.url`
    - `run.get_project_url()` method is deprecated in favor of `run.project_url`
    - `run.get_sweep_url()` method is deprecated in favor of `run.sweep_url`


### Fixed

- Fixed ValueError on Windows when running a W&B script from a different drive (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9678)
- Fix base_url setting was not provided to wandb.login (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9703)
