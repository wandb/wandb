## Unreleased

### Changed

- Runs now write data to disk every 15 seconds, so that wandb leet updates sooner for runs that don't log a lot of data (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12742)
- `wandb.init()` now honors `mode="offline"` and `resume="..."` instead of logging a warning and ignoring the `resume` option. The requested mode is reconciled against the backend when the run is later synced with `wandb beta sync`. (@geoffhardy in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12110)

### Fixed

- Changing system metrics grid rows or columns in LEET, including `wandb leet symon`, no longer crashes and takes effect immediately without waiting for new data (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12763)
