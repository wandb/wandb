## Unreleased

## Changed
- Hardened argument handling in `wandb launch` for the local-process resource so that job-supplied values are always shell-quoted (@nicholaspun-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12220)
- `wandb.init()` now honors `mode="offline"` and `resume="..."` instead of logging a warning and ignoring the `resume` option. The requested mode is reconciled against the backend when the run is later synced with `wandb beta sync`.
