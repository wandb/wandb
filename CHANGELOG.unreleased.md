## Unreleased

### Changed

- `wandb.Api()` now supports an optional `session` argument which can be set to any object compatible with `requests.Session`. This allows advanced users to override HTTP client settings which are not otherwise/directly exposed through public interfaces.

### Fixed

- `wandb.Api(api_key=...)` now prioritizes the explicitly provided API key over thread-local cached credentials (@pingleiwandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10657)
