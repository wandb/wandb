## Unreleased

## Changed
- Shared-mode runs persist `shared` on the transaction log's `RunRecord` at init time. `wandb sync` rejects flagged logs because re-syncing can duplicate metrics; use `--include-shared` to override. (@geoffhardy https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12474)


### Fixed

- File uploads and downloads no longer fail in some cases with `CommError: Failed to execute API request: the service process is busy and did not respond in time` when they take longer than 20 seconds. This was a regression in 0.29.0 (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12603)
