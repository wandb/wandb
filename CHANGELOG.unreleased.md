- Fixed registries fetched using `api.registries()` from having an extra `wandb-registry-` prefix in the name and full_name fields (@estellazx in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10187)
- Fixed a crash that could happen when using `sync_tensorboard` (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10199)
- `Api().run(...).upload_file` no longer throws an error when uploading a file in a different path relative to the provided root directory (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10228)

- When a Sweeps run function called by `wandb.agent()` API throws an exception, it will now appear on the logs page for the run. (This previously only happened for runs called by the `wandb agent` CLI command.) (@kelu-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10244)
