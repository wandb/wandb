## Unreleased

### Fixed

- `wandb.Api(api_key=...)` now prioritizes the explicitly provided API key over thread-local cached credentials (@pingleiwandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10657)
- Fixed a rare deadlock in `console_capture.py` (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10683)
  - If you dump thread tracebacks during the deadlock and see the `wandb-AsyncioManager-main` thread stuck on a line in `console_capture.py`: this is now fixed.
