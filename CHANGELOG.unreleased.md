## Unreleased

### Added

- It is now possible to use resume="must" for offline runs. Syncing will fail if there's no run to resume. (@geoffhardy in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12110)


### Changed

- Runs now write data to disk every 15 seconds, so that wandb leet updates sooner for runs that don't log a lot of data (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12742)

### Fixed

- Auto-generated artifact names (e.g. run tables, incremental tables, and file logs) are now safely bounded to 128 characters with middle ellipsis truncation and CRC32 uniqueness preservation, preventing unexpected client-side validation errors (@somuai in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/11212)
- Changing system metrics grid rows or columns in LEET, including `wandb leet symon`, no longer crashes and takes effect immediately without waiting for new data (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/12763)
