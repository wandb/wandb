This package is used for collecting system information and performance stats,
specifically GPU-related, on Apple's ARM machines.

Based on the excellent https://github.com/exelban/stats project.

To build the binary on your system, make sure you have nox and a Swift compiler
available, and run:

```shell
nox -s build-apple-stats-monitor
```
