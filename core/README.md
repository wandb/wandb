# wandb-core: A New Backend for the W&B SDK

## Introduction

Good News, Everyone! We've developed a new and improved backend for the W&B SDK that is
more performant, versatile, and robust.

## Getting Started

To start using the new backend, add `wandb.require("core")` to your script after importing `wandb`:

```python
import wandb

wandb.require("core")
```

Note: ensure you have `wandb>=0.17.0`.

### Platform Compatibility

`wandb-core` is pre-built for the following platforms:

- Linux:`x86_64`, `aarch64`
- macOS: `x86_64`, `arm64`
- Windows `amd64`

For other platforms, build `wandb-core` from the source as outlined in our [contributing guide](docs/contributing.md#installing-wandb-core). If you're interested in support for additional platforms, please inform us by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/new/choose). Your feedback helps us prioritize new platform support.

### W&B Server Compatibility

`wandb-core` is compatible with our production and dedicated cloud deployments as well as
[W&B Server](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting) versions `>=0.40.0`.

### Switching Back to the Old SDK Backend

To revert to the old SDK backend, remove `wandb.require("core")` from your script.

[^E.1]: `sync_tensorboard` only uploads `tfevent` files to W&B (unverified);
    the metrics will not be logged in native W&B charts.
[^E.5]: `define_metric` only supports default summary.
[^E.8]: Only raw console logging is supported.
[^E.9]: Supported system metrics: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, NVIDIA GPU, AMD GPU, Apple GPU.
[^E.12]: Unsupported settings:
    (`anonymous`, `_flow_control*`, `_stats_open_metrics_endpoints`, ...)
[^CLI.1]: The command is namespaced under `wandb beta` group.
[^CLI.2]: The rest of the CLI works, but uses the old backend under the hood for some
    commands.
