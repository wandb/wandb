// happen in order with Record processing. There are some Records
// that exist only for this purpose, but it is not an appropriate
// use of protos, and it is very limiting.

	// records from the client or reading them from the transaction log.
	// This step can defer record processing until some condition has occurred,

	// from the client. If it blocks too long, client operations like
