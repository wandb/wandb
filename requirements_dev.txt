# TODO: fix extra dependencies
#   We need to improve how we do requirements_dev as specifying .[extra] creates
#   dependencies which are not resolveable by pip when dealing with yea-wandb which also requires wandb.
#   These issues might be temporary as we transition to a released version of wandb which has
#   the necessary support for yea-wandb (namely the relay server).
#   Writing out explicit dependencies here is undesireable as it can get out of sync with setup.py deps.
# .[launch]
# vvvvvvvvvv - below are for extra launch
