History tracks logged data over time. To use history from your script, call
wandb.log({"key": value}) at a single time step or multiple times in your
training loop. This generates a time series of saved scalars or media that is
saved to history.

In the UI, if you log a scalar at multiple timesteps W&B will render these
history metrics as line plots by default. If you log a single value in history,
compare across runs with a bar chart.

It's often useful to track a full time series as well as a single summary value.
For example, accuracy at every step in History and best accuracy in Summary.
By default, Summary is set to the final value of History.

Time series data for Runs. This is essentially a list of dicts where each
dict is a set of summary statistics logged.
