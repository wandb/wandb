# `wandb` service

We are excited :tada: to share with you a new feature we call `service`. This feature is still in the experimental stage, but will be integrated by default in `wandb` in the near future.

## Why would you use this feature?

`service` improves `wandb`'s handling of multiprocessing and thus improves reliability in a distributed training setting.
If you are using `wandb` in a distributed training setup and experiencing hangs, please consider trying out this new feature.

## Usage

### General usage

`service` can be enabled by adding the following to your script:

```python
import wandb

if __name__ == "__main__":
    wandb.require(experiment="service")
    # <rest-of-your-script-goes-here>
```

### Advanced usage example

If you are calling `wandb.init` in a spawned process you should add `wandb.setup()` in the main process:

```python
import multiprocessing as mp
import wandb


def do_work(n):
    run = wandb.init(config=dict(n=n))
    run.log(dict(this=n * n))


def main():
    wandb.require("service")
    wandb.setup()
    pool = mp.Pool(processes=4)
    pool.map(do_work, range(4))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### PyTorch Lightning

If you are using `PyTorch Lightning` please:

- Install the most recent version of `wandb` and update `PyTorch Lightning` from the master branch:

```bash
pip install --upgrade wandb
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/PytorchLightning/pytorch-lightning.git
```

The feature support will be part of `PyTorch Lightning`'s [1.6.0 release](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/pull/11650), at which point you will be able to simply install/update it from PyPI.

That's it... no need to add any further code...

## FAQs

### If your script is stuck in a restart loop

Please try adding:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # <your-script-goes-here>
    ...
```
