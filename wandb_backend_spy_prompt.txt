Rewrite these tests to use the `wandb_backend_spy` fixture. In these tests,
replace calls to `wandb_init()` with `wandb.init()` and use it as a context
manager (don't use `run.finish()`).

Do not change tests that assert on anything in the relay server context other
than history and summary. Do not change tests that inject responses.

When asserting on the summary, use `snapshot.summary(run_id=run.id)` instead of
`relay.context.summary`. Don't use `[0]`.

When asserting on the history, use `snapshot.history(run_id=run.id)`.

Example:

```python
# OLD:
def test_something(relay_server, wandb_init):
    with relay_server() as relay:
        run = wandb_init()
        run.log({"x": 1})
        run.log({"x": 2})
        run.finish()

    assert relay.context.history["x"][0] == 1
    assert relay.context.history["x"][1] == 2
    assert relay.context.summary["x"][0] == 1


# NEW:
def test_something(wandb_backend_spy):
    with wandb.init() as run:
        run.log({"x": 1})
        run.log({"x": 2})

    with wandb_backend_spy.freeze() as snapshot:
        history = snapshot.history(run_id=run.id)
        summary = snapshot.summary(run_id=run.id)
        assert history[0]["x"] == 1
        assert history[1]["x"] == 2
        assert summary["x"] == 2
```
