    Run a W&B project. The project can be local or stored at a Git URI.
    W&B provides built-in support for running projects locally or remotely on a Databricks or
    Kubernetes cluster. You can also run projects against other targets by installing an appropriate
    third-party plugin. See `Community Plugins <../plugins.html#community-plugins>`_ for more
    information.
    For information on using this method in chained workflows, see `Building Multistep Workflows
    <../projects.html#building-multistep-workflows>`_.
    :raises: :py:class:`wandb.exceptions.ExecutionException` If a run launched in blocking mode
             is unsuccessful.
    :param uri: URI of project to run. A local filesystem path
                or a Git repository URI pointing to a project directory containing an MLproject file.
    :param entry_point: Entry point to run within the project. If no entry point with the specified
                        name is found, runs the project file ``entry_point`` as a script,
                        using "python" to run ``.py`` files and the default shell (specified by
                        environment variable ``$SHELL``) to run ``.sh`` files.
    :param version: For Git-based projects, either a commit hash or a branch name.
    :param parameters: Parameters (dictionary) for the entry point command.
    :param docker_args: Arguments (dictionary) for the docker command.
    :param experiment_name: Name of experiment under which to launch the run.
    :param experiment_id: ID of experiment under which to launch the run.
    :param backend: Execution backend for the run: W&B provides built-in support for "local",
                    and "ngc" (experimental) backends.
    :param backend_config: A dictionary, or a path to a JSON file (must end in '.json'), which will
                           be passed as config to the backend. The exact content which should be
                           provided is different for each execution backend
    :param use_conda: If True (the default), create a new Conda environment for the run and
                      install project dependencies within that environment. Otherwise, run the
                      project in the current environment without installing any project
                      dependencies.
    :param storage_dir: Used only if ``backend`` is "local". W&B downloads artifacts from
                        distributed URIs passed to parameters of type ``path`` to subdirectories of
                        ``storage_dir``.
    :param synchronous: Whether to block while waiting for a run to complete. Defaults to True.
                        Note that if ``synchronous`` is False and ``backend`` is "local", this
                        method will return, but the current process will block when exiting until
                        the local run completes. If the current process is interrupted, any
                        asynchronous runs launched via this method will be terminated. If
                        ``synchronous`` is True and the run fails, the current process will
                        error out as well.
    :param run_id: Note: this argument is used internally by the W&B APIs and should
                   not be specified. If specified, the run ID will be used instead of
                   creating a new run.
    :return: :py:class:`wandb.launch.SubmittedRun` exposing information (e.g. run ID)
             about the launched run.
