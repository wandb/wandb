    """A LaunchController is an async function that receives a LaunchControllerConfig and
    a JobSet, and is expected to work continuously to run jobs in the JobSet until the
    JobSet is empty.

    To run a job, the controller must first lease the job by calling job_set.lease_job(id).

    Once the job is running, the controller must ack the job by calling job_set.ack_job(id).

    Once a job has finished, regardless of success/failure, JobSet will automatically remove it from the set. (TODO)

    The controller is responsible for cleaning up jobs once they are complete.

    Lastly, the controller must shut down when the shutdown_event is set, or else it will
    be killed after 30 seconds. (TODO)

    Where appropriate, the controller should honor the configuration specified in
    config.job_set_metadata, e.g., limiting the number of concurrent runs to
    config.job_set_metadata["@max_concurrency"].
