    r"""Declare an overridable configuration file for a launch job.

    If a new job version is created from the active run, the configuration file
    will be added to the job's inputs. If the job is launched and overrides
    have been provided for the configuration file, this function will detect
    the overrides from the environment and update the configuration file on disk.
    Note that these overrides will only be applied in ephemeral containers.
    `include` and `exclude` are lists of dot separated paths with the config.
    The paths are used to filter subtrees of the configuration file out of the
    job's inputs.

    For example, given the following configuration file:
        ```yaml
        model:
            name: resnet
            layers: 18
        training:
            epochs: 10
            batch_size: 32
        ```

    Passing `include=['model']` will only include the `model` subtree in the
    job's inputs. Passing `exclude=['model.layers']` will exclude the `layers`
    key from the `model` subtree. Note that `exclude` takes precedence over
    `include`.

    `.` is used as a separator for nested keys. If a key contains a `.`, it
    should be escaped with a backslash, e.g. `include=[r'model\.layers']`. Note
    the use of `r` to denote a raw string when using escape chars.

    Args:
        path (str): The path to the configuration file. This path must be
            relative and must not contain backwards traversal, i.e. `..`.
        include (List[str]): A list of keys to include in the configuration file.
        exclude (List[str]): A list of keys to exclude from the configuration file.

    Raises:
        LaunchError: If the path is not valid, or if there is no active run.

    r"""Declare wandb.config as an overridable configuration for a launch job.

    If a new job version is created from the active run, the run config
