    A reflink (reflective link) is a copy-on-write reference to a file. Once linked, the

    modified independently without affecting the other; however, they share the same
    underlying data blocks on disk so until one is modified they are "zero-cost" copies.

    Reflinks have all the functionality of copies, so we should use them wherever they
    are supported if we would otherwise copy a file. (This is not particularly radical--
    GNU `cp` defaults to `reflink=auto`, using it whenever available) However, support
    for them is limited to a small number of filesystems. They should work on:
    - Linux with a Btrfs or XFS filesystem (NOT ext4)
    - macOS 10.13 or later with an APFS filesystem (called clone files)

    Reflinks are also supported on Solaris and Windows with ReFSv2, but we haven't
    implemented support for them.

    Like hard links, a reflink can only be created on the same filesystem as the target.
