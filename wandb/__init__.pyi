    You can usually ignore this as it is implicitly called by `wandb.init()`.

    When using wandb in multiple processes, calling `wandb.setup()`
    in the parent process before starting child processes may improve
    performance and resource utilization.

    r"""Start a new run to track and log to W&B.

    In an ML training pipeline, you could add `wandb.init()`
    to the beginning of your training script as well as your evaluation
    script, and each piece would be tracked as a run in W&B.

    `wandb.init()` spawns a new background process to log data to a run, and it
    also syncs data to wandb.ai by default, so you can see live visualizations.

    Call `wandb.init()` to start a run before logging data with `wandb.log()`:
    <!--yeadoc-test:init-method-log-->
    ```python
    import wandb

    wandb.init()
    # ... calculate metrics, generate media
    wandb.log({"accuracy": 0.9})
    ```

    `wandb.init()` returns a run object, and you can also access the run object
    via `wandb.run`:
    <!--yeadoc-test:init-and-assert-global-->
    ```python
    import wandb

    run = wandb.init()

    assert run is wandb.run
    ```

    At the end of your script, we will automatically call `wandb.finish` to
    finalize and cleanup the run. However, if you call `wandb.init` from a
    child process, you must explicitly call `wandb.finish` at the end of the
    child process.

    For more on using `wandb.init()`, including detailed examples, check out our
    [guide and FAQs](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/launch).

    Args:
        project: (str, optional) The name of the project where you're sending
            the new run. If the project is not specified, we will try to infer
            the project name from git root or the current program file. If we
            can't infer the project name, we will default to `"uncategorized"`.
        entity: (str, optional) An entity is a username or team name where
            you're sending runs. This entity must exist before you can send runs
            there, so make sure to create your account or team in the UI before
            starting to log runs.
            If you don't specify an entity, the run will be sent to your default
            entity. Change your default entity
            in [your settings](https://wandb.ai/settings) under "default location
            to create new projects".
        config: (dict, argparse, absl.flags, str, optional)
            This sets `wandb.config`, a dictionary-like object for saving inputs
            to your job, like hyperparameters for a model or settings for a data
            preprocessing job. The config will show up in a table in the UI that
            you can use to group, filter, and sort runs. Keys should not contain
            `.` in their names, and values should be under 10 MB.
            If dict, argparse or absl.flags: will load the key value pairs into
                the `wandb.config` object.
            If str: will look for a yaml file by that name, and load config from
                that file into the `wandb.config` object.
        save_code: (bool, optional) Turn this on to save the main script or
            notebook to W&B. This is valuable for improving experiment
            reproducibility and to diff code across experiments in the UI. By
            default this is off, but you can flip the default behavior to on
            in [your settings page](https://wandb.ai/settings).
        group: (str, optional) Specify a group to organize individual runs into
            a larger experiment. For example, you might be doing cross
            validation, or you might have multiple jobs that train and evaluate
            a model against different test sets. Group gives you a way to
            organize runs together into a larger whole, and you can toggle this
            on and off in the UI. For more details, see our
            [guide to grouping runs](https://docs.wandb.com/guides/runs/grouping).
        job_type: (str, optional) Specify the type of run, which is useful when
            you're grouping runs together into larger experiments using group.
            For example, you might have multiple jobs in a group, with job types
            like train and eval. Setting this makes it easy to filter and group
            similar runs together in the UI so you can compare apples to apples.
        tags: (list, optional) A list of strings, which will populate the list
            of tags on this run in the UI. Tags are useful for organizing runs
            together, or applying temporary labels like "baseline" or
            "production". It's easy to add and remove tags in the UI, or filter
            down to just runs with a specific tag.
            If you are resuming a run, its tags will be overwritten by the tags
            you pass to `wandb.init()`. If you want to add tags to a resumed run
            without overwriting its existing tags, use `run.tags += ["new_tag"]`
            after `wandb.init()`.
        name: (str, optional) A short display name for this run, which is how
            you'll identify this run in the UI. By default, we generate a random
            two-word name that lets you easily cross-reference runs from the
            table to charts. Keeping these run names short makes the chart
            legends and tables easier to read. If you're looking for a place to
            save your hyperparameters, we recommend saving those in config.
        notes: (str, optional) A longer description of the run, like a `-m` commit
            message in git. This helps you remember what you were doing when you
            ran this run.
        dir: (str or pathlib.Path, optional) An absolute path to a directory where
            metadata will be stored. When you call `download()` on an artifact,
            this is the directory where downloaded files will be saved. By default,
            this is the `./wandb` directory.
        resume: (bool, str, optional) Sets the resuming behavior. Options:
            `"allow"`, `"must"`, `"never"`, `"auto"` or `None`. Defaults to `None`.
            Cases:
            - `None` (default): If the new run has the same ID as a previous run,
                this run overwrites that data.
            - `"auto"` (or `True`): if the previous run on this machine crashed,
                automatically resume it. Otherwise, start a new run.
            - `"allow"`: if id is set with `init(id="UNIQUE_ID")` or
                `WANDB_RUN_ID="UNIQUE_ID"` and it is identical to a previous run,
                wandb will automatically resume the run with that id. Otherwise,
                wandb will start a new run.
            - `"never"`: if id is set with `init(id="UNIQUE_ID")` or
                `WANDB_RUN_ID="UNIQUE_ID"` and it is identical to a previous run,
                wandb will crash.
            - `"must"`: if id is set with `init(id="UNIQUE_ID")` or
                `WANDB_RUN_ID="UNIQUE_ID"` and it is identical to a previous run,
                wandb will automatically resume the run with the id. Otherwise,
                wandb will crash.
            See [our guide to resuming runs](https://docs.wandb.com/guides/runs/resuming)
            for more.
        reinit: (bool, optional) Allow multiple `wandb.init()` calls in the same
            process. (default: `False`)
        magic: (bool, dict, or str, optional) The bool controls whether we try to
            auto-instrument your script, capturing basic details of your run
            without you having to add more wandb code. (default: `False`)
            You can also pass a dict, json string, or yaml filename.
        config_exclude_keys: (list, optional) string keys to exclude from
            `wandb.config`.
        config_include_keys: (list, optional) string keys to include in
            `wandb.config`.
        anonymous: (str, optional) Controls anonymous data logging. Options:
            - `"never"` (default): requires you to link your W&B account before
                tracking the run, so you don't accidentally create an anonymous
                run.
            - `"allow"`: lets a logged-in user track runs with their account, but
                lets someone who is running the script without a W&B account see
                the charts in the UI.
            - `"must"`: sends the run to an anonymous account instead of to a
                signed-up user account.
        mode: (str, optional) Can be `"online"`, `"offline"` or `"disabled"`. Defaults to
            online.
        allow_val_change: (bool, optional) Whether to allow config values to
            change after setting the keys once. By default, we throw an exception
            if a config value is overwritten. If you want to track something
            like a varying learning rate at multiple times during training, use
            `wandb.log()` instead. (default: `False` in scripts, `True` in Jupyter)
        force: (bool, optional) If `True`, this crashes the script if a user isn't
            logged in to W&B. If `False`, this will let the script run in offline
            mode if a user isn't logged in to W&B. (default: `False`)
        sync_tensorboard: (bool, optional) Synchronize wandb logs from tensorboard or
            tensorboardX and save the relevant events file. (default: `False`)
        tensorboard: (bool, optional) Alias for `sync_tensorboard`, deprecated.
        monitor_gym: (bool, optional) Automatically log videos of environment when
            using OpenAI Gym. (default: `False`)
            See [our guide to this integration](https://docs.wandb.com/guides/integrations/openai-gym).
        id: (str, optional) A unique ID for this run, used for resuming. It must
            be unique in the project, and if you delete a run you can't reuse
            the ID. Use the `name` field for a short descriptive name, or `config`
            for saving hyperparameters to compare across runs. The ID cannot
            contain the following special characters: `/\#?%:`.
            See [our guide to resuming runs](https://docs.wandb.com/guides/runs/resuming).
        fork_from: (str, optional) A string with the format `{run_id}?_step={step}` describing
            a moment in a previous run to fork a new run from. Creates a new run that picks up
            logging history from the specified run at the specified moment. The target run must
            be in the current project. Example: `fork_from="my-run-id?_step=1234"`.
        resume_from: (str, optional) A string with the format `{run_id}?_step={step}` describing
            a moment in a previous run to resume a run from. This allows users to truncate
            the history logged to a run at an intermediate step and resume logging from that step.
            It uses run forking under the hood. The target run must be in the
            current project. Example: `resume_from="my-run-id?_step=1234"`.
        settings: (dict, wandb.Settings, optional) Settings to use for this run. (default: None)

    Examples:
    ### Set where the run is logged

    You can change where the run is logged, just like changing
    the organization, repository, and branch in git:
    ```python
    import wandb

    user = "geoff"
    project = "capsules"
    display_name = "experiment-2021-10-31"

    wandb.init(entity=user, project=project, name=display_name)
    ```

    ### Add metadata about the run to the config

    Pass a dictionary-style object as the `config` keyword argument to add
    metadata, like hyperparameters, to your run.
    <!--yeadoc-test:init-set-config-->
    ```python
    import wandb

    config = {"lr": 3e-4, "batch_size": 32}
    config.update({"architecture": "resnet", "depth": 34})
    wandb.init(config=config)
    ```

    Raises:
        Error: if some unknown or internal error happened during the run initialization.
        AuthenticationError: if the user failed to provide valid credentials.
        CommError: if there was a problem communicating with the WandB server.
        UsageError: if the user provided invalid arguments.
        KeyboardInterrupt: if user interrupts the run.

    Use `log` to log data from runs, such as scalars, images, video,

    See our [guides to logging](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/log) for
    live examples, code snippets, best practices, and more.

    The most basic usage is `run.log({"train-loss": 0.5, "accuracy": 0.9})`.
    This will save the loss and accuracy to the run's history and update
    the summary values for these metrics.

    Visualize logged data in the workspace at [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai),
    or locally on a [self-hosted instance](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting)
    of the W&B app, or export data to visualize and explore locally, e.g. in
    Jupyter notebooks, with [our API](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/public-api-guide).

    Logged values don't have to be scalars. Logging any wandb object is supported.
    For example `run.log({"example": wandb.Image("myimage.jpg")})` will log an
    example image which will be displayed nicely in the W&B UI.
    See the [reference documentation](https://docs.wandb.com/ref/python/data-types)
    for all of the different supported types or check out our
    [guides to logging](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/log) for examples,
    from 3D molecular structures and segmentation masks to PR curves and histograms.
    You can use `wandb.Table` to log structured data. See our
    [guide to logging tables](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/tables/tables-walkthrough)
    for details.

    The W&B UI organizes metrics with a forward slash (`/`) in their name
    into sections named using the text before the final slash. For example,
    the following results in two sections named "train" and "validate":

    ```
    run.log({
        "train/accuracy": 0.9,
        "train/loss": 30,
        "validate/accuracy": 0.8,
        "validate/loss": 20,
    })
    ```

    Only one level of nesting is supported; `run.log({"a/b/c": 1})`
    produces a section named "a/b".

    `run.log` is not intended to be called more than a few times per second.
    For optimal performance, limit your logging to once every N iterations,
    or collect data over multiple iterations and log it in a single step.

    ### The W&B step

    With basic usage, each call to `log` creates a new "step".
    The step must always increase, and it is not possible to log
    to a previous step.

    Note that you can use any metric as the X axis in charts.
    In many cases, it is better to treat the W&B step like
    you'd treat a timestamp rather than a training step.

    ```
    # Example: log an "epoch" metric for use as an X axis.
    run.log({"epoch": 40, "train-loss": 0.5})
    ```

    See also [define_metric](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/run#define_metric).

    It is possible to use multiple `log` invocations to log to
    the same step with the `step` and `commit` parameters.
    The following are all equivalent:

    ```
    # Normal usage:
    run.log({"train-loss": 0.5, "accuracy": 0.8})
    run.log({"train-loss": 0.4, "accuracy": 0.9})

    # Implicit step without auto-incrementing:
    run.log({"train-loss": 0.5}, commit=False)
    run.log({"accuracy": 0.8})
    run.log({"train-loss": 0.4}, commit=False)
    run.log({"accuracy": 0.9})

    # Explicit step:
    run.log({"train-loss": 0.5}, step=current_step)
    run.log({"accuracy": 0.8}, step=current_step)
    current_step += 1
    run.log({"train-loss": 0.4}, step=current_step)
    run.log({"accuracy": 0.9}, step=current_step)
    ```

    Args:
        data: A `dict` with `str` keys and values that are serializable
            Python objects including: `int`, `float` and `string`;
            any of the `wandb.data_types`; lists, tuples and NumPy arrays
            of serializable Python objects; other `dict`s of this
            structure.
        step: The step number to log. If `None`, then an implicit
            auto-incrementing step is used. See the notes in
            the description.
        commit: If true, finalize and upload the step. If false, then
            accumulate data for the step. See the notes in the description.
            If `step` is `None`, then the default is `commit=True`;
            otherwise, the default is `commit=False`.
        sync: This argument is deprecated and does nothing.

            default to the basename of the path prepended with the current run id  if not specified.
        aliases: (List[str], optional) - alias(es) that will only be applied on this linked artifact
            inside the registered model.
            The alias "latest" will always be applied to the latest version of an artifact that is linked.

    Examples:
        ```python
        run.link_model(
            path="/local/directory",
            registered_model_name="my_reg_model",
            name="my_model_artifact",
            aliases=["production"],
        )
        ```

        Invalid usage
        ```python
        run.link_model(
            path="/local/directory",
            registered_model_name="my_entity/my_project/my_reg_model",
            name="my_model_artifact",
            aliases=["production"],
        )

        run.link_model(
            path="/local/directory",
            registered_model_name="my_reg_model",
            name="my_entity/my_project/my_model_artifact",
            aliases=["production"],
        )
        ```

    Raises:
        AssertionError: if registered_model_name is a path or
            if model artifact 'name' is of a type that does not contain the substring 'model'
        ValueError: if name has invalid special characters
