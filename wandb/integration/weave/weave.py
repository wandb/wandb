"""Integration module for automatic Weave initialization with W&B.

This module provides automatic initialization of Weave when:
1. Weave is installed
2. A W&B run is active with a project
3. Weave is imported (init-on-import)

The integration can be disabled by setting the WANDB_DISABLE_WEAVE environment variable.
