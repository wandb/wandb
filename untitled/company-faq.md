# Company FAQ

### How do I pronounce "wandb"?

You can pronounce it w-and-b \(as we originally intended\), wand-b \(because it's magic like a wand\), or wan-db \(because it saves things like a database\).

### How much does this thing cost?

W&B is free as long as your projects are public or you are working on an academic or open source project. We are committed to staying free for academic and open source projects and making it easy to export data.

If you want to host private projects for a company, email us at [contact@wandb.com](mailto:contact@wandb.com).

### Do you offer an on-premises version of your software?

Yes! If you're interested tell us at [contact@wandb.com](mailto:contact@wandb.com).

### How is this different from TensorBoard?

W&B is a distributed, cloud-hosted solution. Your results are saved forever, and our interface is still snappy after 1000's of runs. We offer additional features such as system metrics, commit history, experiment notes, dashboards, and advanced search and aggregation across runs and projects.

### Why are you doing this?

At Weights & Biases our mission is to build the best tools for machine learning. Our experienced technical cofounders built Figure Eight, and our tools are being used by cutting-edge machine learning teams including OpenAI and Toyota. We enjoy making useful tools, and the best part of our day is interacting with people who are building real models using our product.
