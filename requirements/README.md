This folder contains Python dependencies needed for development and CI.

For local development, use `uv pip install -r requirements/requirements_dev.txt`.

CI uses precompiled files for speed and reproducibility. Use `bash requirements/generate.sh` or see the top of each file for the command used to generate it.
