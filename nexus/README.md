# W&B Nexus: the new "bones" for the W&B SDK

## What is Nexus

Greetings, developers! Let's dive right in!

What is W&B Nexus? At the highest level, Nexus is the new "bones" for the W&B SDK.
Why would anyone care and want to use it? There are numerous reasons, but here are just two:
- It's faster. A lot faster. We're talking 10x faster for some operations.
- It enables clean multi-language support.

For those technical folks out there, `nexus` is a Golang reimplementation of the W&B SDK
internal process, `wandb service`, based on the lessons learned from the original implementation(s),
but starting from a clean slate.

## Feature Parity Status

The following table shows the current status of feature parity between the current W&B SDK.

Status legend:
✅: Available: The feature is relatively stable and ready for use
🚧: In Development: The feature is available, but might lack some functionality
📝: Todo: The feature has not entered development yet.

| Category   | Feature               | Status | Notes         |
|------------|-----------------------|--------|---------------|

|            | incremental artifacts | 📝     |               |
|            | reference artifacts   | 📝     |               |
| Public API |                       | 📝     | [PA.1](#PA.1) |

<a name="PA.1">[PA.1]</a> The public API works, but uses the current Python backend under the hood.
    Expect the public API to be rewritten to use the new backend.
