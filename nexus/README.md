## What is Nexus?

Greetings, developers!

*What is Project Nexus?* At the highest level, Nexus is a new backend for the W&B SDK.

*Why would anyone care and want to use it?* There are multiple reasons, but here are just two:
- It's faster. A lot faster. We're talking orders of magnitude faster for some operations.
- It enables clean multi-language support.

`nexus` is a Golang reimplementation of the W&B SDK internal process, `wandb service`,
based on the lessons learned from the original implementation(s),
but starting from a clean slate.

## Installation

To install Nexus, you will need to run the following commands:

```bash
pip install "wandb[nexus]" --pre
```

### Supported Platforms

Nexus is currently supported on the following platforms:

- Linux:`x86_64`, `aarch64`
- macOS: `x86_64`, `arm64`
- Windows `amd64`

If you are using a different platform, you can build Nexus from the source by following the
instructions in the [contributing guide](docs/contributing.md#installing-nexus).
Please also open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/new/choose)
to let us know that you are interested in using Nexus on
your platform, and we will prioritize adding support for it.

## Usage example

While Nexus is still in development, you need to explicitly opt-in to use it.

```python
import wandb

wandb.require("nexus")

# Your code here using the W&B SDK
```

## Contributing

Please read our [contributing guide](docs/contributing.md) to learn to set up
your development environment and how to contribute to the codebase.

## Feedback
Please give Nexus a try and let us know what you think, we believe it is worth it!

We are very much looking forward to your feedback, especially bug reports.
Please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/new/choose)
if you encounter an error, mention that you are using Nexus.

[^E.1]: `sync_tensorboard` requires TensorBoard sync support.
[^E.5]: `define_metric` only supports default summary.
[^E.8]: Only raw console logging is supported.
[^E.9]: Supported system metrics: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, NVIDIA GPU.
[^E.12]: TODO: list unsupported settings.
    (`anonymous`, `_flow_control*`, `_stats_open_metrics_endpoints`, ...)
[^CLI.1]: The CLI works, but uses the current Python backend under the hood for some
    commands. Expect the CLI to be rewritten to use the new backend.
[^A.1]: Artifacts are partially supported. Expect full support in the near future.
[^L.1]: Launch is not yet supported.
[^S.1]: Requires verification.
